# Designing Wireless Networks


Overall summary of the wireless network design includes followingT 

- **Defining the requirements** for wireless support The number of end-user devices that should be supported for each location in the network needs to be determined.

- **Conducting an RF site survey** : To define the RF characteristics in the environment
  Identify potential areas of interference or coverage holes.
     
- **Defining access point deployment locations** based on the site survey and customer requirements.

- **Determining wireless LAN (WLAN) controller (WLC) design** using recommended practices

- **Implementing redundancy** using primary, secondary, and potentially, tertiary WLCs

- **Placing the WLCs** in the distribution layer

- Determining whether remote sites will use **local or centralized controllers**

-  Determining the number of **mobility groups** that will be needed: Mobility groups are needed for seamless roaming.

- Planning how to support **internal VLANs and guest access** if needed (based on the customer requirements).

- Seeing how the Cisco Unified Wireless Network architecture centralizes WLAN configuration and control on WLCs that control CAPWAP access points.

- Understanding how the Cisco Unified Wireless Network provides transparent roaming supporting both intracontroller and intercontroller roaming. 

- Deterministic controller redundancy with integrated RRM provides the highest-quality roaming experience.

- Reviewing how an RF survey in a wireless network design determines the characteristics of the wireless network and access point placement to provide optimal RF coverage for wireless clients.


## Some of the questions you can ask for while designing wireless for campus

1. How many access points are needed?
2. Where should the access points be placed?
3. How will the access points receive power?
4. How many WLCs will be needed?
5. Where should the WLCs be placed?
