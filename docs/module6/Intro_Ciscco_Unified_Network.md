# Wireless Network Design Considerations  ( 03 Hours )

## What is Wireless Network and why do we need it ?

- A wireless LAN (WLAN) provides network connectivity over radio waves. 

- Wireless stations such as PCs and Personal Digital Assistants (PDA) connect to a wireless access point using half-duplex transmissions.

- The access point connects to the wired network. Organizations are deploying WLANs to increase employee productivity, enhance collaboration, and improve responsiveness to customers

## How traditional WLAN works ?

Traditionally, each access point in a WLAN operates as a separate autonomous node configured with Service Set Identifier (SSID), RF channel, and RF power settings

## Are ther any problems with traditional WLAN setup ? 

Yes ! 

1. Managing Large Numbers of Siloed Access Points is Difficult 
2. Security, VLANs, and Guest User Policies Cannot be Managed
3. Traffic flow of clients is handled on individual, siloed radios
4. There is no support for technologies like 802.11r, Layer 3 roaming, global bandwidth, or QoS policy enforcement
5. Autonomous deployments rarely offer support for advanced wireless features that many enterprises use, including Real-Time Location System (RTLS)
6. No Support for Real-Time Software Updates or Advanced Networking Features

## What is Cisco Unified Wireless Network Solutions ? How it Works ? What all services it provides ? 

The Cisco Unified Wireless Network architecture allows the WLAN to operate as an Intelligent Information Network and support advanced mobility services. 

It is composed of five interconnected elements that work together to deliver a unified, end-to-end, enterprise-class wireless solution

- Client devices
- Access points
- Network unification
- World-class network management
- Mobility services

Lets see each of these elements in details 

### Client devices
- With more than 90 percent of shipping client devices certified as Cisco compatible, these devices support Cisco equipmentâ€™s powerful advanced features.

### Access points
- Dynamically configured access points provide ubiquitous network access in all environments

- Enhanced productivity is supported through plug and play with Lightweight Access Point Pro-
tocol (LWAPP) and Control and Provisioning of Wireless Access Points Protocol (CAPWAP)

- All Cisco lightweight access points support mobility services, such as fast secure roaming for voice and location services for real-time network visibility.

### Network unification

- Integration of the wired and wireless network is critical for unified network control, scalability, security, and reliability
- Seamless functionality is provided through wire less integration into all major switching and routing platforms

### World-class network management

- Security, scalability, reliability, ease of deployment, and management for WLANsis provided through network management systems such as Cisco Wireless Control System (WCS)
- WCS visualizes and helps secure the air space.
- Context-aware mobility services are provided with the Cisco Mobility Service Engine.

### Mobility Services 

- Enhanced mobility services
- Voice services
- Context-aware mobility services
- Guest access

## Finally can you tell me what are the benefits of the Cisco Unified Wireless Network architecture ?

1. Ease of deployment and upgrades
2. Reliable connectivity through dynamic RF management
3. Optimized per-user performance through user load balancing
4. Guest networking
5. Layer 2 and 3 roaming
6. Embedded wireless intrusion detection system (IDS)
7. Location services
8. Voice over IP
9. Lowered total cost of ownership (TCO)
10. Wired and wireless unification
