+ Transition from Analog to Digital Systems


## Advantages

Some of the major advantages of wireless communications are mobility, increased reliability, ease of installation, rapid disaster recovery and above all lower cost.

+ Mobility - freedom to move about while remaining connected with the network within its coverage area
+ Increased Reliability - Wireless technology eliminates problem of cable failures, and increases the overall reliability of the network
+ Ease of Installation - time required to install network cabling may take days or even weeks to complete but in wireless very quick installation
+ Rapid Disaster Recovery- Ability to have the network up and immediately working after a disaster is critical in wireless its possible to recover faster
+ Lower Cost - Due to no need of cables cost is reduced 
 
## Disadvantages 

Some of the disadvantes of the Wireless Networks include

+ Radio Signal Interference from other devices 
+ Security Issues due to open signal
